  - name: modeled__dlt_load_times_parsed
    description: >
      This model highlights how complete bikeshare data is as ingested by dlt from the Bikeshare API.
  - name: modeled__station_status_load_delta
    description: >
      This model compares load ingestion times with the last reported time for each station
      to size out the delta between actual data and when it was ingested. We consider "15 minutes" to 
      be the threshold for what is considered "late" or "fresh".
  - name: modeled__station_status_with_station_info
    description: >
      Station status enriched with station metadata. Joins bike/dock availability with static station
      info (name, capacity) and calculates availability rates.
